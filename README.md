# GTAV-PS3-1.12-SPRX
 My sprx mod menu for gta v, designed for version 1.12 bles

Much of the code is specifically designed to work across many versions of the game by using signatures, but not all of it (ie some of the in-progress things). If you want to make a build for other versions I suggest removing some of the in progress items with hard coded addresses.
